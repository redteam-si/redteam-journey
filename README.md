# 👋 Hi, I'm Shahbaz!

I'm a curious and hands-on security learner transitioning from over a decade in IT operations to offensive security and penetration testing.

🔧 My background includes:
- Support Windows Server and Network Infrastructure for Microsoft Customers
- In-house IT support and infrastructure operations across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Endpoint management using Intune, JAMF, SCCM, and PDQ
- Vulnerability remediation workflows with Tenable and ServiceNow

🕵️ Now focused on:
- Network and web application pentesting
- Privilege escalation, reverse shells, and post-exploitation
- Building, breaking, and documenting vulnerable lab environments
