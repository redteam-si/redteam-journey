# 🕵️ Red Team Journey

Welcome to my **Red Team Journey** repo!  
This is where I document my transition into offensive security and penetration testing.  

📌 Over the past year, I’ve been practicing on CTF platforms, labs, and vulnerable environments. Much of this was originally captured in **Obsidian** and **CherryTree**, and I’m now transferring it here in an organized way.

---

## 🔎 Repo Highlights

- **labs/** → Hands-on practice with HackTheBox, VulnHub, and CTF challenges.
- **scripts/** → Python, Bash, and PowerShell scripts I wrote for automation and enumeration.
- **notes/** → Quick reference notes on pentesting techniques.
- **projects/** → Larger builds like my Active Directory lab setup and phishing simulation.
